        <h1>WG VISITOR PARKING RULES AND REGULATIONS: (upd 5/23/25)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure fair and equal opportunity to use visitor parking spots by all current owners, legitimate tenants, and their guests, permitted PARKING TIME IS LIMITED TO 24 HOURS per each QR code scan. After expiration of that time, within a 15-minute grace period, the driver must repeat the QR code scan to extend the parking time—up to another 24 hours—or immediately remove their vehicle.</li>
            <li>OVERSTAY-PARKING with no scan within the grace period will be charged $35 and the vehicle will be subject to towing.</li>
            <li>EVERY CONDO UNIT HAS A CREDIT FOR 8 x 24 HOURS SHARED FREE PARKING TIME PER CALENDAR MONTH! Not transferable to the next month or a different unit.</li>
            <li>EXCESS-PARKING days by any and all vehicles will be charged at $15 per day. A scan is required for every day.</li>
            <li>VEHICLES PARKED WITHOUT QR CODE SCAN AND TEXT MESSAGE WITH REQUIRED INFO WILL BE TAGGED FOR VIOLATION AND TOW SERVICE WILL BE CALLED.</li>
            <li>The Association reserves the right to use all legal means of immobilizing or bracing the vehicle while on the Association's property until fees are collected in full.</li>
            <li>
                Vehicle operators must agree to all rules above and click the button below to open your default texting application to register the parked vehicle with WG Association. Do not forget to enter the building and unit number you are visiting or live in, and to snap a photo of your vehicle and license plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE AND DO NOT SEND TEXT WITH REQUIRED INFO, PLEASE REMOVE YOUR VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE PARKING SPOT SO THAT OTHERS MAY USE IT. THERE IS PLENTY OF PARKING ON THE CITY STREETS AROUND THIS PROPERTY. THANK YOU.
            </li>
